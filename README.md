Source code for presentation slides on the topic of asynchronous flow control in Javascript with ES6 Generators. The slides can be viewed online here: LINK GOES HERE

The framework used to create the slides is [Caleb Troughton's deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/), along with some slight modifications. Please refer to that link if you would like to create a presentation like this one.

The theme initially applied was [Groovecoder's Mozilla Sandstone theme for deck.js](https://github.com/groovecoder/deckjs-theme-mozilla) (sandstone.dark.css)

## Workflow

In case you are cloning this repo and not the original deck.js:

1. Do something. TODO

## Browser Compatibility

Code compatibility has been done only for the presenting machine (modern Chrome) in mind. Pay special attention to the following, if you decide to use any other browser:

- Radial gradients: Did not do vendor-prefix redundancyness.
- @font-face: Only reads .otf.
